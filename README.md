## BASH SCRIPTS 
I made these because i am too lazy lol.
They automate some tasks i cannot be bothered to remember how to do

<p> Tasks include </p>
<ul>
<li> Update Angular </li>
</ul>

To use run make it executable with `chmod 755 {{script}}` then run it with `./{{script}}`
<hr/>

<p>Personally, i made a bin folder in my home directory then added that folder to $PATH.</p>
<p>So i can execute my scripts in there without having to navigate to their location  </p>
